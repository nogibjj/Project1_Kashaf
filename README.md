# Project1_Kashaf

Hi, this is my first project for my IDS706: Data Engineering course. I will be writing a Big Data Script that uses the Pandas API for Dask and will also use FastApi with Uvicorn to create a microservice. Below is the layout for my project and the main steps I will follow:

Data Source

I will be using a big dataset for Spotify Charts from Kaggle (linked [here][1]). This is a complete dataset of all the "Top 200" and "Viral 50" charts published globally by Spotify since January 1, 2017. The main columns in this dataset are as follows: title, rank, date, artist, url, region, chart, trend
